A linear regression model describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X. The dependent variable is also called the response variable. Independent variables are also called explanatory or predictor variables.There are several components of the linear model, including the channel, sender, receiver, encoding, decoding, and noise. A channel is the way the message is sent, such as an email or a face-to-face meeting. The sender may be referred to as a source as this is the person who sends out or distributes the message
